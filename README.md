DreamPainter allows users to view real-life landscape photospheres and, using the Gear VR's controls, toggle through the various stylized versions of those photospheres.

What it does:
DreamPainter allows users to view real-life landscape photospheres and, using the Gear VR's controls, toggle through the various stylized versions of those photospheres. In an experimental mode, users can also "paint" the style of multiple artists onto the landscape photosphere with a virtual "brush", so they can mix and match multiple styles on the same sphere!
